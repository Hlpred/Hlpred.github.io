A hybrid fixed wing and quadrotor UAV is a vehicle that posesses the features of both types of aircraft. These include an airfoil spanning the lenght of the vehicle, a front propeller to generate thrust, and four vertical propellers that counteract gravity and provide control authority. Note that the airfoil does not necessarily need to produce enough lift to support the vehicle on its own. It is acceptable that the four upward propellers provide some of the remaining verticle force. The advantages of a vehicle like this are that it has the potential to be more energy efficient than a typical quadrotor while still retaining the ability to hover in place or perform vertical take off and landing.

The goal of this project was to complete the mechanical design of a hybrid UAV intended to test experimental control strategies. The starting point for this project was a rough range of acceptable vehicle masses, wingspans, and crusing speeds. From there, the optimal airfoil shape and its ideal angle of attack for the expected range of Reynold's numbers (Re) had to be determined. The NACA 6412 airfoil at an angle of attack of about five degrees was selected due to its high L/D ratio over the range of Re values. Next, hand calculations were performed to determine the maximum forces and moments on the vechile for a range of wingspans. This allowed for carbon fiber supports to be selected based on their cross sectional geometry and yield strength. Finally, with the basic structural and aerodynamic requirmenets satisfied, the vehicle could be designed in SolidWorks. One of the most challenging aspects of the design was creating a spring locking mechanism that could hold the four propeller arms in both stowed and extended positions. This is because parts of the mechanism have small cross sections, but must be able to wistand the forces applied to the arm at crusing speed.
